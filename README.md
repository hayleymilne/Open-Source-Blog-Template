Open-Source-Blog-Template
=========================

Introduction to Open Source Template:

This template was created for CPSC 101 at UBC, with the intention of providing an easy template for those with minimal programming knowledge. The template utilizes CSS, HTML and JavaScript.  An example of the blog template can be found at: http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~v9w8/index.html 

First before editing the HTML files download: 

Font Awesome at http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/

Bebas Neue: http://fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/

To see everything correctly, place all files in the same folder. 

My recommendation is to edit the HTML page first, as it give you a better understanding of what is placed where, however you can edit the CSS stylesheet first
 
Additionally, there are comments on how to use the elements within the files and where to place certain links or information.

http://www.w3schools.com/ is a good resource for questions about what a certain tag may be.

Things to note: 
		          	Place long blog posts paragraph by paragraph and inside 
		          	<div> with the class specific in the file. 
			
		          	Sections may occur on several pages, to avoid filling them up repeatedly copy and paste 
		          	a completed section in the place of an empty one.
